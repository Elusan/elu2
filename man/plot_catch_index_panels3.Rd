\title{Plot Catch and Index Time Series Panels}
\usage{
plot_catch_index_panels3(data_list, output_dir = "FIG")
}
\arguments{
\item{data_list}{A named list with elements:
\describe{
\item{timeC}{Numeric vector of years for observed catch}
\item{obsC}{Numeric vector of observed catch values}
\item{timeI}{A list of numeric vectors, each containing years for a standardized index}
\item{obsI}{A list of numeric vectors, each containing values for the corresponding index}
}}

\item{output_dir}{Character string specifying the folder where the PNG plot will be saved.
Defaults to \code{"FIG"}. If the directory does not exist, it will be created.}
}
\value{
A \code{patchwork} object representing the combined plot. Also saves the plot to a PNG file.
}
\description{
Generates vertically stacked panel plots showing observed catch (as histograms)
and standardized index values (as lines/points) for each index in a provided data list.
Each plot panel includes a markdown title with sample size summaries and index year range,
consistent y-axis scaling, and a shared x-axis spanning all years in the catch time series.
}
\details{
For each index, the function:
\itemize{
\item Restricts the display of catch bars to the range of years covered by that index
\item Plots index values as red lines and points (on a scaled right y-axis)
\item Sets a common y-axis range and scaling factor across all panels
\item Adds rich plot titles using \code{ggtext::element_markdown()} with sample sizes and year ranges
}
Panel spacing and legend positioning are customized for publication-quality output.
