\title{Plot SPiCT Model Scenarios (6 panels) with SPiCT-style colored CIs & borders}
\usage{

  models,

\description{
3Ã—2 grid for multiple SPiCT models (e.g., S1P, S1F, S1S). Each model gets:
\itemize{
\item estimate line in its own color,
\item a semi-transparent CI ribbon in the same color,
\item thin CI band borders (upper/lower) in the same color with reduced alpha,
mirroring the visual style used in \code{plot2_elu2_gg_good_AJUSTED.EE()}.
Thin solid grey vertical lines mark end-of-observations (SPiCT convention).
}
