\title{Plot and Export a Grid of Kobe Plots for Multiple Models/Scenarios}
\usage{
multi_kobe_plot2(
  models,
  model_labels = NULL,
  scenario_label = NULL,
  ncol = NULL,
  width = 8,
  height = 5,
  save_pdf = NULL,
  save_png = NULL,
  save_panel_pngs = TRUE,
  panel_dir = "kobe_panels",
  text_cex = 2,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{A named list of model fit objects. Each object should be accepted by \code{elu_plot_kobe()}.}

\item{model_labels}{Optional. Character vector of labels to use for each model panel. If \code{NULL}, uses \code{names(models)}.}

\item{scenario_label}{Optional. Title placed above the Kobe grid (e.g., scenario name).}

\item{ncol}{Integer. Number of columns in the grid. If \code{NULL}, uses one column per model.}

\item{width}{Numeric. Width (in inches) of each individual Kobe plot panel. Default is 8.}

\item{height}{Numeric. Height (in inches) of each individual Kobe plot panel. Default is 5.}

\item{save_pdf}{Optional. File path (character) to save the Kobe plot grid as a PDF. If \code{NULL}, grid is not saved as PDF.}

\item{save_png}{Optional. File path (character) to save the Kobe plot grid as a PNG. If \code{NULL}, grid is not saved as PNG.}

\item{save_panel_pngs}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), saves each individual Kobe plot panel as a PNG file in \code{panel_dir}.}

\item{panel_dir}{Character. Directory to save individual Kobe panel PNGs (created if it does not exist). Default is \code{"kobe_panels"}.}

\item{text_cex}{Numeric. Text size (cex) for model label inside each plot panel. Default is 2 (large and clear).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{elu_plot_kobe()} for plot customization.}
}
\value{
The function is called for its side effects (plotting and saving image files). Invisibly returns \code{NULL}.
}
\description{
Generates a visually enhanced grid of Kobe plots (biomass vs. fishing mortality relative to MSY reference points) for a set of models or scenarios. For each model, an individual Kobe plot is saved as a high-resolution PNG in a dedicated directory. The full grid can also be saved as a PDF and/or PNG file. All plots are annotated with scenario/model labels for clear identification and publication-quality visuals.
}
\details{
For each model in the input list, this function:
\itemize{
\item Creates a Kobe plot using \code{elu_plot_kobe()}, saves it as a high-resolution PNG (panel), and reads it back as a grob for flexible grid arrangement.
\item Annotates each plot with the corresponding model label (top-left, bold, colored).
\item Optionally saves the entire grid of Kobe plots as a PDF and/or PNG, with a scenario label at the top.
}
The function ensures crisp, publication-quality images suitable for use in reports, presentations, or manuscripts.
