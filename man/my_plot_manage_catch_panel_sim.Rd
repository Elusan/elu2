\title{Catch panel (ggplot2) with MSY band and optional scenario overlays}
\usage{
my_plot_manage_catch_panel_sim(
  rep_man,
  scenario_color = NULL,
  show_CIs = TRUE,
  CI = 0.95,
  show_legend = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rep_man}{A fitted SPiCT report object (\code{spictcls}), optionally with \verb{$man}.}

\item{scenario_color}{Optional named character vector of colours for scenarios.}

\item{show_CIs}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, draws dashed CI edges for base Cpred up to \code{t0}.}

\item{CI}{Confidence level in (0, 1). Default \code{0.95}.}

\item{show_legend}{Logical; show scenario legend when scenarios exist. Default \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Plots observed and predicted catch time series with an MSY reference band.
If management scenarios are present in \code{rep_man$man}, their predicted catch
trajectories are overlaid with a stable colour mapping and canonical ordering.
For raw fits (no scenarios), base predicted catch is solid up to the last
observed catch start and dotted thereafter; CI edges can be shown before the
management start (\code{t0}) when available.

When \code{rep_man$inp$true} is present (simulations), a \strong{horizontal “True MSY”}
overlay is drawn exactly like \code{plotspict.catch()}: first a solid
semi-transparent orange line (\code{true.col()}), then a black dotted line on top.
No legend entry is added for this overlay.
