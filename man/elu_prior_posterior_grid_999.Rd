\title{Create and Save a Grid of Prior vs Posterior Plots for Multiple Models}
\usage{
elu_prior_posterior_grid_999(
  models,
  priors_fun = priors.elu6,
  width = 15,
  height = 10,
  dpi = 300,
  outdir = "FIG",
  file_prefix = NULL,
  return_patchwork = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{A named list of fitted SPiCT model objects (e.g., from \code{fit.elu2()}).
The names should follow a pattern like "S1P", "S1F", etc., where the
scenario prefix (e.g., "S1") is automatically extracted.}

\item{priors_fun}{A function used to generate the prior vs posterior plots for a single model.
Must return a list of ggplot objects (one per active prior).
Default is \code{\link{priors.elu6}}.}

\item{width}{Width of the final PNG figure in inches. Default: \code{15}.}

\item{height}{Height of the final PNG figure in inches. Default: \code{10}.}

\item{dpi}{Resolution (dots per inch) for the saved figure. Default: \code{300}.}

\item{outdir}{Directory to save the figure in. Created if it does not exist. Default: \code{"FIG"}.
If \code{NULL}, no file is saved.}

\item{file_prefix}{Optional prefix for the filename. If \code{NULL}, the prefix is extracted
from the first model name by removing trailing model identifiers (e.g., "P").}

\item{return_patchwork}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, returns the patchwork object containing the full grid.
If \code{FALSE}, the function runs for its side effects (i.e., saving the figure).
Default: \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A patchwork object if \code{return_patchwork = TRUE}, otherwise invisibly returns \code{NULL}.
}
\description{
This function generates a grid of prior vs posterior plots for a list of SPiCT models,
organizing them with models as rows and priors as columns. Missing priors are replaced
with empty spacer plots to maintain consistent layout.
}
\details{
The function determines which priors are active across all models and creates a grid of plots where
each row corresponds to a model and each column to a prior. If a prior is not used in a model,
an empty placeholder is inserted in its position to preserve alignment. The final grid can be saved
as a PNG and/or returned as a patchwork object for further use.
