\title{Plot a Grid of Kobe Plots for Multiple Models/Scenarios}
\usage{
multi_kobe_plot(
  models,
  model_labels = NULL,
  scenario_label = NULL,
  ncol = NULL,
  width = 6,
  height = 5,
  save_pdf = NULL,
  text_cex = 1.5,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{A named list of model fit objects. Each should be accepted by \code{elu_plot_kobe()}.}

\item{model_labels}{Optional. Character vector of labels to use for each model panel. If NULL, uses \code{names(models)}.}

\item{scenario_label}{Optional. Main grid title placed above all panels.}

\item{ncol}{Integer. Number of columns in the grid. If NULL, uses one column per model.}

\item{width}{Numeric. Width (in inches) of each individual Kobe plot panel. Default is 6.}

\item{height}{Numeric. Height (in inches) of each individual Kobe plot panel. Default is 5.}

\item{save_pdf}{Optional file path (character). If provided, saves the output grid to this PDF file.}

\item{text_cex}{Numeric. Text size (cex) for model label inside each plot panel. Default is 1.5.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{elu_plot_kobe()}.}
}
\value{
The function is called for its side effect of plotting the grid of Kobe plots to the current graphics device (or to a PDF). Invisibly returns \code{NULL}.
}
\description{
Generates a grid of Kobe plots (biomass vs. fishing mortality relative to MSY reference points) for a set of models, with each plot labeled by its corresponding model. Optionally, saves the grid as a PDF file.
}
\details{
For each model in the input list, this function generates a Kobe plot by calling \code{elu_plot_kobe()} (which must plot to the current device), writes the plot to a temporary PNG, and reads it back as a grob for flexible grid arrangement. Each panel is annotated with its model label in the top-left corner. Optionally, a scenario title can be placed above the grid. If \code{save_pdf} is specified, the grid is saved to the provided PDF path.
