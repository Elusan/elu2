\title{Multi-panel SPiCT management plot with Kobe panel (ggplot2)}
\usage{
plot2_elu2_gg_good(
  rep_man,
  scenario_color = NULL,
  show_CIs = TRUE,
  CI = 0.95,
  return_patchwork = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rep_man}{A fitted \code{spictcls} object for which \code{manage(rep)} has been run.}

\item{scenario_color}{Optional named character vector of colors for scenarios.
If \code{NULL}, a repeatable default palette is used. Names must match
\code{names(rep_man$man)}. Unnamed vectors will be matched in order.}

\item{show_CIs}{Logical; show SPiCT-style CIs for the historical base series
and for base predicted catch up to the management start. Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{CI}{Numeric in (0,1); confidence level for intervals. Default \code{0.95}.}

\item{return_patchwork}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), returns a 2×2 patchwork
layout. If \code{FALSE}, returns a named list of ggplot objects:
\code{list(bbmsy, catch, ffmsy, kobe)}.}
}
\value{
Either a patchwork object (default) or a named list of ggplot objects.
}
\description{
Produces a 2×2 layout of management diagnostics for a fitted \strong{SPiCT} object
with scenarios generated via \code{spict::manage()}:
\strong{B/Bmsy}, \strong{Catch}, \strong{F/Fmsy}, and a \strong{Kobe} plot.
\itemize{
\item Time-series panels show a thin \strong{solid grey} vertical line at the start
and end of the management interval.
\item In the \strong{Catch} panel, the \strong{left} vertical line is aligned with the
\strong{last observed catch start} (\code{timeC} tail), while the \strong{right} vertical
line is at the management start.
\item Historical base (≤ last observation) B/Bmsy and F/Fmsy appear in SPiCT-blue
with CIs; scenario lines are overlaid in user-supplied or default colors.
\item The Kobe panel uses \strong{absolute} primary axes (Bt, Ft) with \strong{relative}
secondary axes (Bt/Bmsy, Ft/Fmsy). When growth is time-varying, axes switch
to relative.
}
}
\section{Notes}{

\itemize{
\item Observed catches are plotted at \code{timeC} (start of interval); predicted catches
at \code{timeCpred} (SPiCT convention).
\item Vertical lines in time-series panels are \strong{solid grey} (thin).
\item In the Catch panel, the left line is at the \strong{last observed} catch start
(tail of \code{timeC}), and the right line is at the \strong{management start}.
