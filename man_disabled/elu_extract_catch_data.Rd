\title{Extract Observed and Predicted Catch Time Series from SPiCT Model Fit}
\usage{
elu_extract_catch_data(fit, scenario_name = "Base", CI = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A fitted SPiCT model object (typically the output of \code{fit.spict()} or a compatible function). Must include input list \code{inp} and prediction results.}

\item{scenario_name}{Character. Name of the scenario/model for labeling in the output (default: "Base").}

\item{CI}{Numeric. Width of confidence interval to extract for predictions (default: 0.95).}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
\item{time}{Time of observation or prediction (year or fractional year).}
\item{catch}{Catch value (tons, annualized if appropriate).}
\item{lwr}{Lower confidence interval (only for predicted catches; NA for observed).}
\item{upr}{Upper confidence interval (only for predicted catches; NA for observed).}
\item{catch_type}{Type: "Observed" or "Predicted".}
\item{scenario}{Name of the scenario/model for labeling.}
}
}
\description{
Returns a tidy data frame containing both observed and model-predicted catches (and their confidence intervals) for a given scenario from a SPiCT model fit. Handles both annual and seasonal data.
}
\details{
This function extracts both observed and predicted catch time series from a SPiCT model fit. For seasonal data (where \code{dtc < 1}), the function annualizes both observed and predicted catches and their time points using the \code{annual()} function, then calculates mean or median values across each year. For standard annual models, catches are used as-is.

Output columns include time, catch (tons), lower and upper CI (for predicted only), type ("Observed" or "Predicted"), and scenario label.
